Solar Panel Route Graph Project

This program is a part of a final project for CIS 7. 

The purpose of this project is to implement a graph in C++. It displays adjacencies, edges, routes, cheapest routes, paths, and shortest paths.
The approach to implement a discrete structure (a graph) into C++ is done by using functions and an emphasis on structs and classes.
The graph is created by the developer inputting edges and creating a graph object. Routes, paths, and edges are also input by the developer.
The results are displayed in the console.

This program was created by Gregorio Camarena. 

How to use:
When prompted, enter the choice from the ones displayed on the menu. Output for that option will appear in the console. Press 5 to exit!
