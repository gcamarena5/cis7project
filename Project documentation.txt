1. Chosing the solar one.
Most likely will work alone.

Adjacency list is done. Need to work on determing paths.


First, will create a path list on my own.
And then implement into the program.

A short path

0 -> 1 -> 2

Some program design:

A main menu
with each choice seperate into either a switch statement, 
or use function calls.
I want to include everything in a do while loop so the
program repeats!

5/6/2023
Basic do while loop was implemented and adjacency list 
display as well.

Possible paths
(0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,2)(1,3) (2,3)

Must implement a way to display possible paths 
and their weight.

(0 - 1 - 2 - 3)
(0 - 1 - 3 - 2)
(0 - 2 - 1 - 3)
(0 - 2 - 3 - 1)
(0 - 3 - 1 - 2)
(0 - 3 - 2 - 1)

Investigating the viability of the do while loop.
Addign comments, gutting the edges, and am going to rework that from the ground up

5/13/2023
Am adding in manually via cout statements the edges and routes. Will figure out a way to code these later.
done!
5/14/2023
Found a way to display edges! I created an
edges struct, and displayed it with a for loop.
5/16/2023
an idea: create a route struct
with first, second, third, and fourth values
it wokred! need to implement weight values
they have been implemented

created a github account

5/17
combined the routes and shortest trips into one
found a way to find the cheapest trip via a for loop to look for a low index.
Focus now...make the project more modular? and clean up the code a bit. 
As of now, am getting the github setup. 
once I feel the .cpp is good, I shall add it here as well.
5/18
Am making the program more modular and cleaning up main by adding each option into its own function.
