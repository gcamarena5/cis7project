This project is to display a graph. It displays adjacencies, edges, and routes.
The approach to implement a discrete structure (a graph) into C++ and display its vertex and adjacencies is done via functions and an emphasis on structs and classes.
The graph is created and displayed via the console. Adjacencies and such are also shown this way.

This program was created by Gregorio Camarena. 

How to use:
When prompted, enter the choice displayed on the menu. Said option should appear in the console. Press 4 to exit!
